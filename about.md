Hi, I'm Jette and this is my latest blog. It's very plain because we're having some fun figuring out how to do it with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Over the years, I've written for so many online journals and blogs and online media sites that I've nearly lost track. Maybe you know me, maybe you don't. I have a tendency to ramble when no one is actually paying me to write something. I write about movies a lot.
